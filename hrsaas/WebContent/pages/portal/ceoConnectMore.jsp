		<p align="justify" class="blacklink">In India, we have leveraged
		on our expertise and bundled our IMS offerings to create a whole new
		market for transformational IMS services. We identified opportunities
		and have built innovative IMS offerings, which has significantly
		increased the value proposition of our customers. The progress so far
		has been very satisfying. We have built strong capabilities and
		expertise in the Indian market and also have the strategy in place to
		capture substantial share of the North American IMS market where our
		presence has significantly expanded with the DecisionOne acquisition.
		We need to continue the focus and build our competencies, monitor the
		marketing environment to excel in the ever changing business.</p>
		<p align="justify"><span class="style1"> At this point, I
		would like to share a story, which truly inspires me</span><span
			class="blacklink">. In 1883; a creative engineer named John
		Roebling was inspired to build a spectacular bridge connecting New
		York with the Long Island. However experts throughout the world
		thought that this was an impossible feat and told Roebling to forget
		the idea. But he didnot give up and he managed to convince his son
		Washington who was an engineer, that the bridge could be built.<br>
		<br>
		Working together, they developed concepts and with great excitement
		and inspiration, they began to build their dream bridge. The project
		started well, but when it was only a few months underway a tragic
		accident on the site took the life of John Roebling and injured
		Washington, which resulted in him not being able to walk or talk or
		even move.<br>
		Everyone felt that the project should be scrapped. In spite of his
		handicap Washington was never discouraged and he tried to inspire and
		pass on his enthusiasm to some of his friends, but they were too
		daunted by the task. As he lay on his bed in his hospital room, with
		the sunlight streaming through the windows, a gentle breeze blew the
		flimsy white curtains apart and he was able to see the sky and the
		tops of the trees outside for just a moment.<br>
		<br>

		It seemed that there was a message for him not to give up. Suddenly an
		idea hit him. All he could do was move one finger and he decided to
		make the best use of it. By moving this, he slowly developed a code of
		communication with his wife.<br>
		He touched his wife s arm with that finger, indicating to her that he
		wanted her to call the engineers again. Then he used the same method
		of tapping her arm to tell the engineers what to do. It seemed foolish
		but the project was under way again.<br>
		<br>
		For 13 years Washington tapped out his instructions with his finger on
		his wife s arm, until the bridge was finally completed. Today the </span><span
			class="style1">spectacular Brooklyn Bridge stands in all its
		glory as a tribute to the triumph of one man s indomitable spirit and
		his determination not to be defeated by circumstances</span><span
			class="blacklink"><strong>. </strong>The Brooklyn Bridge shows
		us that dreams that seem impossible can be realized with determination
		and persistence, no matter what the odds are.</span></p>
		<p align="justify"><span class="blacklink">What one
		requires is a vision, a dream to make a difference. I want each one of
