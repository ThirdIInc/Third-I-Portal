				<p class="txt"><strong>1to1help</strong> provides counselling
				services to companies as well as individuals. As pioneers in the
				field we have been able to clearly establish the relevance of
				counselling in the corporate sector.
				
				Knowing the need for counselling in today's world, yet recognizing
				the strong stigma attached to counselling in the Indian context,
				1to1help has developed a unique combination of services that
				overcomes many of the barriers to seeking counselling while catering
				to a large population.</p>
				<p class="txt">Our uniqueness lies in the processes put in place
				to ensure maximum utilization and confidentiality, our multi-pronged
				approach and our experience with issues specific to the Indian
				industry.</p>
				<span class="txt">1to1help's unique Employee Assistance
				Programme, developed over 5 years of corporate counseling experience
				in India, offers a combination of services ideally suited to the
				Indian setting.

				</span>
				<p class="txt">Counselling is provided by a team of
				professionally qualified, trained counselors, widely experienced in
				dealing with the whole gamut of problems faced by 'normal' people.
				(Their profiles are available for registered users to view on the
				1to1help.net website). The team approach makes it possible to offer
				a very high quality of service to large numbers across the country.
				
				A range of counseling options is available:</p>
				<span class="headerDashlet">FACE TO FACE COUNSELLING :</span> <span
					class="txt">is available by prior appointment in Bangalore,
				Chennai, Delhi, Mumbai, Pune and Kolkota at the 1to1help premises.
				</span>
				<span class="headerDashlet">TELEPHONE COUNSELLING : </span><span
					class="txt">provides a certain degree of anonymity and is
				also suitable for those who are constrained by time or distance.
				</span>
				<span class="headerDashlet">ONLINE COUNSELLING :</span> <span class="txt">a
				concept pioneered in India by 1to1help, utilizes secure web-based
				messaging. (Employees log on to a secure web page and send a message
				via a password-protected, secure form.) This option provides
				convenience, accessibility, security and relative anonymity
				(extremely important in the Indian scenario).
